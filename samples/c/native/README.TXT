README.TXT for the native sample.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The native sample demonstrates how to create a loadable native module containing a
class with native methods. The native module is called Sample and the native class is
called Shape.

Files:
    Shape.es        - Class file for the Shape class
    Shape.c         - Native methods for the Shape class. Also contains the modules initialization entry point.
    Sample.slots.h  - Generated slot offsets for the Shape class. Generated by ejsmod.
    main.es         - Main test program

To build:
    make

To run:
    ejs main.es

Requirements:
    This samples requires that Ejscript be configured and built with configure --shared. 
    However, the sample could be adapted for use in static programs if you manually
    invoke the ejsControlModuleInit() function from your main program. See the
    embed sample for how to embed Ejscript in an application.
