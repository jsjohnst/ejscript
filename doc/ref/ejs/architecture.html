            <h1>Ejscript Architecture</h1>
            <p>This document describes the Ejscript Language Architecutre and how it processes program scripts. It
            describes the flow of execution and the main processing components. Sometimes architectural overviews can
            be a bit dry. To liven it up, you may wish to see the <a href="../../guide/ejs/users/tour.html">Ejscript
            Language Tour</a> first.</p>
            <p>See also the <a href="webArchitecture.html">Ejscript Web Framework architecture</a> which describes the
            Ejscript Web Framework.</p>
            <h3>Ejscript Language Architecutre</h3>
            <p>Ejscript consists of an optimizing compiler, an embeddable virtual machine, a system library and a set
            of tools. All were designed and implemented to provide a high performance and compact server-side
            JavaScript programming environment.</p><img src="../../images/architecture.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>The main components of the Ejscript language environment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#tools">Command Tools</a> - Programs to compile, interpret and manage Ejscript

            </ul><a name="tools" id="tools"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Command Tools</h2>
            <p>Ejscript provides a set of commands to interpret, compile and manage ejscript programs and
            documentation. These commands are invoked from the command line and are used manually and also
            automatically by the Ejscript web framework and other embedded programs.</p>
            <p>Ejscript provides the following command tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ejs - Ejscript command shell</li>
                <li>ejsc - Ejscript compiler</li>
                <li>ejsweb - Web framework generator</li>
                <li>ejsmod - Module manager and documentation generator</li>
                <li>ejsvm - Ejscript virtual machine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For full details about the command line options, please see the <a href=
            "../../guide/ejs/programmers/man.html">Manual Pages</a> for these commands. <a name="vm" id="vm"></a></p>
            <h2 class="section">Virtual Machine</h2>
            <p>The Ejscript virtual machine is a portable, cross-platform virtual machine optimized for embedded use
            outside browsers. It has a compact byte code that minimizes memory use and supports cached compilation of
            scripts for repeated execution.</p>
            <p>It is a direct-threaded, stack-based, early-binding, high-level, type-less byte code, cloning, composite
            native classed VM. Each of these attributes is described below.</p>
            <h3>Direct Threaded</h3>
            <p>Direct-threaded refers not to multi-threading, but to an approach in VM design where the VM inner loop
            will jump directly from opcode to opcode without a central dispatch loop. Direct threading can sometimes
            have an adverse effect on CPU instruction caching, but this can be offset by having a high level byte code
            that can invoke operations directly on properties without having a fetch-do-store cycle. We aim to further
            mitigate cache depletion by the use of inline native code generation in a future release.</p>
            <h3>Stack Based</h3>
            <p>Ejscript uses a stack-based expression stack with bypass opcodes. This is a blend of the stack-based and
            register-based approaches to VM design. By using high-level byte codes that can access, manipulate and call
            properties directly, and bypass the expression stack, Ejscript avoids the overhead of a stack-based VM and
            gains many of the benefits of a register-based approach.</p>
            <h3>Early Binding</h3>
            <p>The VM makes extensive use of early binding to resolve property references into direct references and
            has many dedicated op codes for fast property access. The Ejscript compiler tries wherever possible to bind
            property references to property slot offsets and uses these optimized opcodes for such accesses. This
            binding is used not just for load/store operations but also for function calls and object creation.</p>
            <h3>Object Shaping</h3>
            <p>Ejscript optimizes the creation of classes and objects. It detects when objects are being created using
            prototype based inheritance and then transparently creates backing classes. These classes allow very fast
            property access and quick repeat object allocations.</p>
            <h3>High Level, Type-Less Byte Code</h3>
            <p>The Ejscript byte code learns from the best of thinking in recent VM byte code design, and has a
            high-level, type-less byte code with out-of-band exception handling.</p>
            <p>What is somewhat unusual about the Ejscript VM design, is the lack of dedicated type byte codes. There
            are no string or number byte codes -- all types are treated equally. This has freed up large swathes of
            byte codes to be allocated to optimized property access byte codes.</p>
            <p>The compiler uses the optimized early binding byte codes to streamline data access and the VM ensures
            valid binding at run-time. The net result is a very compact byte code and tiny program footprints. For
            embedded web applications this is ideal and translates to fast loading and response.</p>
            <h3>Cloning</h3>
            <p>Ejscript supports multiple interpreters with define data interchange mechanisms. This ensures security
            where the data from one interpreter is not visible from another. Ejscript also supports rapid cloning of
            interpreters from a master interpreter. This is used in the Ejscript web framework to quickly create an
            interpreter to service a web request. Memory footprint and garbage collection overhead is minimized by
            read-only sharing of system types and classes between interpreters.</p>
            <h3>Composite Native Classes</h3>
            <p>Ejscript supports composite native types and classes that can be created in native C code. A composite
            native class is one where the properties of the class are not represented as discrete Ejscript properties
            that exist in the VM in their own right, but rather as native system types. This can dramatically compress
            native classes down to the minimum storage required to represent the objects state. Composite native
            classes have several benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They run much faster because they can access properties natively without going via the VM.</li>
                <li>The memory footprint requirements are much smaller, typically more than a 10x reduction in
                size.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example: A video class may have height and width coordinate properties. In a normal scripted or
            native class, these would be discrete Ejscript numeric objects with their own storage. In a composite
            native class, the class will store these internally as packed, native integers.</p>
            <p>Ejscript can support composite native types because the VM and its native type interface delegates
            operations to the native types themselves. This is in keeping with the high-level byte code philosophy.</p>
            <h3>Garbage Collector</h3>
            <p>The Ejscript garbage collector is a generational, non-compacting, mark and sweep collector. It is
            optimized for use in embedded applications - particularly when it is embedded inside web servers.</p>
            <p>The garbage collector is generational in that it understands the ages of objects and focuses on
            collecting more recent garbage first and most aggressively. This results in short, quick collection cycles.
            This works especially well for web applications where the per-request interpreters are cloned from a master
            interpreter. In this case, most of the long lived generation of system classes and types reside in a master
            interpreter and are best not considered for collection.</p>
            <p>The collector is also integrated into the event mechanism so that collections will run during idle
            periods for longer running or event based applications.</p>
            <p>The garbage collector is non-compacting because for short duration applications the overhead of
            compacting memory outweighs the benefit. Furthermore, by using direct object references, early-binding and
            direct-threading, the VM can have very optimized code paths when accessing object properties.</p>
            <p>For web applications, more generalized garbage collectors are sometimes less suited as they are often
            optimized for long running applications, whereas web applications are typified by short running requests.
            For such short applications, the collector should not waste time doing unnecessary collections and may, in
            fact, not need to be run at all. The Ejscript memory allocator frees entire arenas of memory at the
            completion of web requests and thus avoids garbage collection in many cases.</p>
            <p>When objects are collected, they are recycled via type-specific object pools that provide very rapid
            allocation of new object instances.</p>
            <h3>Future VM Enhancements</h3>
            <p>This VM is a good platform for future enhancements. The byte code was designed to support inline native
            code interleaving where the compiler can selectively generate native code blocks. The compiler will be able
            to generate this native code either when pre-compiling for maximum speed or on-the-fly as a just-in-time
            compiler.</p><a name="compiler" id="compiler"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Compiler</h2>
            <p>The Ejscript compiler is an optimizing script compiler that generates optimized byte code. It has up to
            4 passes depending on the mode of compilation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Parse</li>
                <li>Conditional compilation and hoisting</li>
                <li>Early binding</li>
                <li>Code generation</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The compiler supports conditional compilation based upon the evaluation of constant time
            expressions.</p>
            <p>The Ejscript compiler can run either stand-alone or be embedded in a shell or other program.</p>
            <h3>Embedded Compilation</h3>
            <p>When the Ejscript compiler is embedded into another application, it provides a one-step compile and
            execute cycle. The byte code output of the compiler can optionally be cached as module files or can be
            simply created, executed, and then discarded.</p>
            <p>The <i>ejs</i> command shell uses this approach to provide an interactive Ejscript command shell. The
            Appweb and Apache web servers also use this approach to host the Ejscript web framework for web
            applications.</p>
            <h3>Stand Alone Compilation</h3>
            <p>The Ejscript compiler can also operate in a stand-alone mode where scripts are compiled into optimized
            byte code in the form of <a href="#modules">module</a> files. These compact module files can be distributed
            and executed by the VM without requiring further use of the compiler. This is often ideal for embedded
            applications where saving the memory footprint normally occupied by the compiler is a compelling
            advantage.</p>
            <p>Compiling scripts into byte code and module files at development time has other advantages as well. The
            compiler can spend more time optimizing the program and thus generate better byte code. If the program is
            expected to run many, many times - spending some development cycles to produce the best code possible is
            well worth the effort. The code may also be more secure as the source code for the program is not being
            supplied &mdash; only the byte code.</p>
            <p><a name="modules" id="modules"></a></p>
            <h2 class="section">Modules</h2>
            <p>Ejscript provides a <b>module</b> language directive and module loading mechanism that permits like
            sections of a program to be grouped into a single loadable module.</p>
            <p>The Ejscript module directive solves several problems for the script developer</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to package script files into a convenient package.</li>
                <li>How to provides a unique, safe namespace for declarations that is guaranteed not to clash with
                other modules.</li>
                <li>How to specify and resolve module dependencies.</li>
                <li>How to version and permit side-by-side execution of different versions of the same module.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Module Packaging</h3>
            <p>The Ejscript module format provides a compressed archive of module declarations in a single physical
            file. The module file contains byte code, constant pool, debug code, exception handlers and class and
            method signatures. A single module file may actually contain multiple logical modules. This way, an
            application containing more than one module may still be packaged as a single module file.</p>
            <p>The compiler has the ability to compile multiple source files and generate one file per module or
            optionally merge input files (or modules) into a single output module. The compiler thus functions as a
            link editor resolving module dependencies and ensuring the final module contains all the necessary
            dependency records.</p>
            <p>When debug information is enabled (via the --debug switch) the compiler will store debug information in
            the module file to enable symbolic debugging. Ejscript currently does not (yet) have a symbolic debugger,
            but trace output and C level debugging can inspect script source statements and line numbers.</p>
            <h3>Module Namespaces</h3>
            <p>Ejscript provides a safe namespace by using namespaces to qualify module names. The namespace for a
            module ensures that two declarations of the same name, but in different modules can be correctly identified
            by the compiler and VM.</p>
            <p>Namespaces are mostly transparent to the user and module writer - except that the user imports the
            module by using a "use module" directive, and the module writer publishes a module by bracketing the code
            in a "module" directive.</p>
            <h3>Module Dependencies</h3>
            <p>The Ejscript module file format specifies any and all dependent modules that are required by the module.
            A module dependency is specified in the Ejscript source program via the "use module" directive. This
            instructs the compiler to load (or compile) that module and perform various compile time and run time
            checks. The VM module loader will load all dependent modules and initialize them in the appropriate
            order.</p>
            <p>Module names are opaque, but by convention must uniquely qualify a module name. You can use a reverse
            domain naming convention to ensure uniqueness. It is anticiapted that in the future, some form of module
            registry will exist to reserve unique names.</p>
            <h3>Side by Side Execution</h3>
            <p>Because modules load in dedicated and isolated namespaces, a module is guaranteed not to clash with
            other names. Module writers can version packages by adding a version namespace in addition to the module
            namespace. The user of the module can then put a "use namesapce" directive in their code to request a
            specific version of the module.</p><a name="library" id="library"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Core Class Library</h2>
            <p>The core Ejscript class library provides an extensive suite of classes that cover common programming
            tasks and requirements. These are divided into the following modules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>intrinsic - Core system types</li>
                <li>ejs.db - Database</li>
