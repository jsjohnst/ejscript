            <h1>Porting Ejscript</h1>
            <p>Porting any software is not for the novice. It requires considerable skill to read another person's code
            and adapt it to a new environment. These instructions are intended for experienced developers who want to
            port Ejscript to a new operating system or processor architecture.</p>
            <p>Ejscript has been written to maximize the ease of porting to a new environment. The O/S and
            processor-dependent code have been contained while the bulk of the code is cross-platform. Most of this
            dependent code is under the <b>src/mpr</b> sub-directory which represents the Embedthis Portable Runtime
            (MPR).</p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> When attempting a port, you should get the latest copy of the development source branch
            rather than using the download source package. You can get the latest development source by checking out a
            copy from the <a href="http://hg.embedthis.com/ejs/">repository</a>.</p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> Please read <a href="building.html">Building from Source</a> before your read this
            document. It provides valuable background about the Ejscript build system.</p><a name="newOs" id=
            "newOs"></a>
            <h2>Steps in Porting to a new Operating System</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Select the required Ejscript features</h3>
                    <p>Edit the build/standard.defaults configuration file. This file contains the factory defaults for
                    the configure program. Select the features you wish to support. But start with the smallest set
                    possible.</p>
                    <p>You should turn BLD_FEATURE_MULTITHREAD off (use configure --disable-multi-thread) for your
                    first porting effort as it will make debugging much easier. Disable all the features that your O/S
                    does not support. See the <a href="building.html">Building from Source</a> document for definitions
                    of all the build variables used in these files.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Define your O/S configuration string</h3>
                    <p>The configure program uses two programs to parse --host and --build switches. They are:
                    build/bin/config.guess and build/bin/config.sub. Most probably, your O/S and CPU architecture are
                    already in this file, but if you are porting to a new operating system, these script programs may
                    not recognize your --host settings.</p>
                    <p>The --host and --build switches take a system architecture specification in the form:
                    CPU-VENDOR-OS. For example: i386-pc-linux, or, powerpc-wrs-vxworks. The host system is the target
                    system that will eventually run Ejscript. The build system is the system being used to compile and
                    build Ejscript. The config.sub program takes an abbreviated system string and emits a fully
                    qualified architecture specification. The config.guess program attempts to sleuth your build
                    string.</p>
                    <p>You may need to define new MPR_CPU constants in the mpr/mpr.h file if you are doing a port to a
                    new CPU architecture that is not already supported. You also may need to edit
                    build/bin/config.guess. This program is run by configure to parse the --host and --build
                    configuration values.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Prepare configure for the new target operating system.</h3>
                    <p>If you create porting to a new unsupported operating system, you will need to create a new
                    configure template in the "build/config" directory. The configure templates supply the default
                    values for various configuration options including file extensions and system directories.</p>
                    <p>You may also need to modify the component search scripts in build/components. These scripts are
                    run by configure to scan your system for supported components. Configure will load the
                    "build/env.config", "build/standard.defaults" and "build/product.config" files. These have key
                    parameters used by configure. You may need to modify these files.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Run configure for the new target operating system.</h3>
                    <p>When ready, run configure to generate the buildConfig.make, buildConfig.sh and buildConfig.h
                    master build files. For example:</p>
                    <pre>
./configure --disable-all --host=powerpc-wrs-vxworks
</pre>
                    <p>After running configure, check the output in build/buildConfig.make. If your system is UNIX
                    like, make sure you set BLD_UNIX_FOR_HOST to 1 in the build/standard.defaults configuration
                    file.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Pick a Name for the Operating System Port</h3>
                    <p>If you are doing a port for a new operating system, you need to pick a symbolic name that will
                    be used in Makefiles, build scripts and for operating system specific directories. Use all CAPS for
                    your OS name without any "_" or "-" characters. For example: "LINUX" is the Ejscript name for the
                    Linux specific portions. For the rest of this document, we will use the name <b>NEWOS</b> for the
                    O/S symbolic name.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Select the Base O/S to Copy</h3>
                    <p>The easiest way to port to a new O/S is to find the closest existing supported O/S that the
                    Ejscript software already supports and use it as a base to modify. For example, if you are porting
                    to QNX, you may want to use the LINUX port as a base.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tailor the Make directives file: make.os.NEWOS</h3>
                    <p>This step is probably one of the longest. You need to edit the build/make/make.os.NEWOS file and
                    change all the compiler and linker flag values for your operating system. See the <a href=
                    "building.html">Building from Source</a> document for definitions of all the make variables used in
                    this file.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tailor the cross-platform O/S header.</h3>
                    <p>To insulate most of the Ejscript source code from the differences of various operating systems,
                    the <b>include/</b><b>mpr.h</b> header file wraps all the required O/S headers and publishes a
                    consistent set of types and prototypes. None of the source files include normal O/S headers like
                    &lt;string.h&gt;. While this does slow the build by including more headers than are required
                    &mdash; it is barely noticeable on modern CPUs.</p>
                    <p>When porting mpr.h, start by copying the sections in mpr.h that pertain to your base copied O/S.
                    These will be protected by "#if BASE_OS" defines. In the example of NEWOS, we would look for, and
                    copy, any sections with "#if LINUX" and create "#if NEWOS" sections.</p>
                    <p><b>DO NOT</b> introduce conditional code in other O/S sections. It is better to copy the entire
                    contents from the base O/S and modify. It is better to isolate the code for each O/S.</p>
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b> the mpr.h and mpr.c files are an all-in-one amalgamation of lots of smaller mpr
                    files. When you have finished your port, the changes to mpr.h and mpr.c will need to be back-ported
                    to the mpr release at <a href="http://hg.embedthis.com/mpr">http://hg.embedthis.com/mpr</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tailor the Primary MPR header</h3>
                    <p>Next we edit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">include/mpr.h</span> header. Some operating
                    system differences escape from mpr.h and must be dealt with here. Search for sections that pertain
                    to the base O/S and modify. It is acceptable and indeed preferable to modify sections rather than
                    replicate. For example:</p>
                    <pre>
#if LINUX || QNX
</pre>
                    <p>is better and clearer than duplicate code.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Test the Headers with a Hello World Program.</h3>
                    <p>Don't use the make system yet. Just create an empty C hello world program and include "mpr.h".
                    Compile it and shake out the issues. You will need to define "-DNEWOS" on your compiler command
                    line.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Port the per O/S MPR Source Code</h3>
                    <p>Now is the time for the real work. You will probably need to modify the mpr.c file.</p>
                    <p>In it, you will see banners marking where the various sub-files have been catenated together.
                    The main sections to modify will be mprOs.c, mprSocket.c, mprThread.c mprTime.c and mprWait.c. The
                    mprThread.c file contains the multiprocessing thread, lock and condition variable code. If you only
                    intend to support single-threading, you can largely skip these code sections.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Test the Make Subsystem</h3>
                    <p>To aid the porting to many operating systems, a simple build system that is somewhat compatible
                    with GNU configuration standards is provided. While the GNU Autoconf/Libtool system could arguably
                    do the job, it struggles in non-Unix environments and lacks control for some cross-compilation
                    scenarios. The Ejscript build and make system makes fewer demands on the underlying operating
                    system and is simpler in scope.</p>
                    <p>The make subsystem requires GNU make and a fairly compliant bash shell implementation. If you
                    are using windows, the CYGWIN package will provide the GNU environment. If you are porting to an
                    O/S that uses the GNU development tools, you probably have little to do in this step. If not, you
                    may require more modifications required to your make.rules file.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Test Compile the Mpr</h3>
                    <p>To start out, test compile one file in MPR first. Let's pick an easy one: <b>buf.cpp.</b> The
                    Ejscript build system compiles objects for most directories into a top level objects directory
                    (./obj). This is done to make it easier to aggregate objects from various modules into common
                    libraries. So to compile a single object, you need to specify the target object which will usually
                    not be in the current directory.</p>
                    <pre>
cd mpr
make 
</pre>
                    <p>At this stage of the porting effort, the <b>make</b> command will undoubtedly provoke a stream
                    of errors. Use this to work out the bugs in mpr.h, mpr.c and make.rules for your O/S.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Compile and Test ejs -- the Ejscript Interpreter</h3>
                    <p>This code should compile and build easily. It is quite cross-platform.</p>
                    <pre>
cd src
make clean depend compile test
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Test Ejscript</h3>
                    <pre>
cd test
make test
</pre>
                </li>

            <h2 class="section">Working with the Ejscript Development Team</h2>
            <p>Once you have a basic port running, you should send it back for the team to look over. They can provide
            advice and suggestions. At the first opportunity, your changes may be merged back into the development tree
            so others can benefit from your work.</p>
            <p>Good luck and all the best. Please give feedback to the development team at <a href=
