NAME
       ejsmod - Ejscript Module Generator

SYNOPSIS
       ejsmod  [--cslots]  [--empty]  [--html  path] [--listing] [--searchPath
       ejsPath] [--showBuiltin] [--showDebug] [--version] modules ...

DESCRIPTION
       The ejsmod command is a utility program for Ejscript  module  files  to
       generate  symbolic  assembler listings, slot defintion files for native
       classes and HTML documentation.

LISTINGS
       To generate symbolic assembler listings, compile your source using  the
       ejsc  command  with  the  --debug  switch.  Then invoke ejsmod with the
       --listing switch and supply the required modules. An assembler  listing
       file  with  a ".lst" extension will be generated for each corresponding
       logical module directive.

       The listing files interleave disassembled byte code with  the  relevant
       source  code statements. The listings describe each module and its con-
       stituent functions and initializers. The bindings for all types and the
       constant pool are also listed.

DOCUMENTATION
       To  generate  HTML documentation for your code, first compile using the
       ejsc command with the --doc switch. Then  invoke  ejsmod  and  use  the
       --html  switch with the directory where you want the documentation gen-
       erated.

       The HTML documentation will include  all  modules,  namespaces,  types,
       functions, properties and variable declarations.

BINDING SLOT FILES
       Ejscript supports the creation of native types which are coded in the C
       language. Native types are useful for core system types and for classes
       that  must  run  at  near  binary  speed. To facilitate creating native
       types, ejsmod generates slot binding definition  headers  which  define
       symbolic  offsets  for  declarations.  See the Native class samples for
       further information.

OPTIONS
       --cslots
              Generate slot binding definition headers for the input  modules.

       --empty
              Start  with an empty interpreter without the core language types
              such as Object, Array and Number. This option is used  to  build
              the  foundation  ejs.mod  module  which contains the core system
              types.

       --html dir
              Generate HTML documentation  to  the  specified  directory.  The
              source  files  must  have  been  compiled by ejsc with the --doc
              switch to include the documentation strings in the module files.

       --listing
              Generate symbolic assembler files for each input module.

       --searchPath ejsPath
              Override the module search path. The module search path is a set
              of directories that the ejsmod command will  use  when  locating
              and  loading Ejscript modules. Given a module named "a.b.c" in a
              script, ejsmod will use the following search strategy to  locate
              the module:

              1. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod"

              2. Search for a module file named "a/b/c.mod"

              3. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod" in EJSPATH

              4. Search for a module file named c.mod in EJSPATH

              The search path is initially specified via the environment vari-
              able EJSPATH and may be overridden via the --searchPath  ejsPath
              switch.  EJSPATH  and the ejsPath command line value are similar
              to the system PATH formats. On windows, path segments are  sepa-
              rated  by ";" and on Linux, Unix, FreeBSD and MAC, the path seg-
              ments are separated by ":" delimiters.

       --showDebug
              Show debug instructions in the symbolic assembler listings.

       --showBuiltin
              Show built-in properties in HTML documentation, assembler  list-
              ings and slot binding files.

       --version
              Print the ejsmod command version and exit.

BACKGROUND
       Ejscript  is  an enhanced implementation of the JavaScript language for
       use in embedded applications such as web servers, embedded devices  and
       mobile  phones. It is especially well suited for Server-Side JavaScript
       web applications.

       Ejscript is a dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented scripting  language
       that supports classes, objects, exceptions, statements, expressions and
       a powerful suite of data types.
